This Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between the Producer ("You") and Sweet Dreams Music LLC ("Platform"), governing the listing, licensing, and distribution of musical compositions ("Beats") on the Platform.

1. REVENUE SPLIT
All revenue generated from the licensing or sale of your Beats through the Platform shall be split as follows:
- Producer: 60% of gross sale price
- Platform: 40% of gross sale price
Payouts are processed on a regular schedule. The Platform handles all payment processing and applicable fees.

- Display, promote, and distribute the Beat through the Platform's beat store
- Facilitate licensing transactions (MP3 Lease, Trackout Lease, Exclusive Rights) on your behalf
- Use the Beat title, audio preview, and your producer name in marketing materials related to the Platform
- Upload and publish the Beat's tagged/watermarked preview to the Platform's YouTube channel and social media accounts for promotional purposes
- List and sell the Beat through affiliated studio locations and partner platforms operated under the Platform's network, with the same revenue split applied
This license is non-exclusive. You retain ownership of your Beats and may sell or license them through other channels. Beats sold through affiliated studio locations are subject to the same 60/40 revenue split and all earnings are credited to your producer account regardless of which studio location facilitates the sale.

- You have the legal authority to enter into this Agreement

4. PLATFORM RESPONSIBILITIES
The Platform agrees to:
- List and promote approved Beats on the beat store and affiliated studio platforms

- Handle all payment processing, licensing documentation, and file delivery to buyers
- Provide a producer dashboard with sales tracking, earnings reports, and payout history
- Remit the Producer's share of revenue according to the agreed split, including sales made through affiliated studio locations

5. SAMPLE CLEARANCE
You are solely responsible for ensuring all samples used in your Beats are properly cleared for commercial licensing. The Platform is not liable for any copyright claims arising from uncleared samples. If a Beat is found to contain uncleared samples, the Platform reserves the right to immediately remove it from the store.

6. CONTENT REMOVAL
The Platform reserves the right to remove any Beat from the store at any time for policy violations, legal concerns, quality standards, or any other reason at its sole discretion.

7. TERMINATION
Either party may terminate this Agreement with 30 days written notice. Upon termination:
- Active license agreements with buyers remain in effect
- The Producer's Beats will be removed from the store
- Any pending earnings will be paid out according to the regular payout schedule
- The Producer may not relicense or resell any Beat that was sold as an Exclusive through the Platform

8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
The Platform shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from this Agreement. The Platform's total liability shall not exceed the total amount paid to the Producer under this Agreement.

9. GOVERNING LAW
